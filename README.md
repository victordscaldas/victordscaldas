### Hi there, I'm Victor Caldas ðŸ‘‹

My name is Victor Caldas, i was born and live in **Rio de Janeiro - RJ**. I've been working as a Developer since 2015 and I'm passionate about everything that involves technology.

I am currently studying Computer Engineering at **University CÃ¢ndido Mendes (UCAM)** and working as a Fullstack Developer at the **State University of Rio de Janeiro (UERJ)**.

In my free time, I like to listen to music, watch movies and series, read/study about philosophy (Yes, that's right!) and discover new places ;)
